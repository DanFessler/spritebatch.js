# spritebatch.js

Spritebatch.js is a utility for rendering 2D textures using WebGL, for when the HTML5 Canvas
rendering API is unsuitable. 

Spritebatch.js was originally developed during the development of the game 
[Idle Provinces](https://idleprovinces.northronics.com), to facilitate rendering
more than two hundred unevenly shaped, randomly generated regions in different
colors. 

## Install

    npm install spritebatch --save
